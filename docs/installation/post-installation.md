## Folder structure

Hummingbot is **local client software** that you run on your own machine, so you have full control over how it’s configured and where you save your files. No one else can access your data and secrets! 

If you installed Hummingbot via Docker, your `/hummingbot_files` folder contains the following folders:
```
hummingbot_files
    ┣ conf
        ┣ connectors
        ┣ strategies
    ┣ logs
    ┣ data
    ┣ scripts
```

If you installed Hummingbot from source, you should also see a `hummingbot` folder that contains the core Hummingbot classes, components, and connectors:
```
hummingbot
    ┣ conf
        ┣ connectors
        ┣ strategies
    ┣ logs
    ┣ data
    ┣ scripts
    ┣ hummingbot
```

Here is what each folder contains:

- `/conf`: General folder for configuration files

- `/conf/connectors`: Exchange API keys encrypted by your [password](/operation/password/)

- `/conf/strategies`: Strategy config files that you can `create` and `import`

- `/logs`: Log files generated by your scripts and strategies

- `/data`: SQLite databases and CSV files for the trades executed by your scripts and strategies

- `/scripts`: This folder contains the sample scripts, and you can add new scripts here to make them available to the `start` command

## Launching Hummingbot

### Docker

If you used Docker Compose to deploy Hummingbot, you can launch the network from the directory that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file with:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Then, attach to it (typically, the container name is `hummingbot`):
```
docker attach <container-name>
```

If you are using the older helper script method, use the `hummingbot-start.sh` script from the [Bash Scripts](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/development/bash_scripts) repo.

### Source

If you installed Hummingbot from source, make sure that the hummingbot conda environment has been activated before you run Hummingbot:
```
conda activate hummingbot
```

If you have made any changes,  make sure to re-compile the code with `./compile` to ensure that any changes to Cython files are compiled before running Hummingbot:
```
./compile
```

Afterwards, from the root directory, run this command:
```
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## Exiting Hummingbot

Running the `exit` command cancels all outstanding orders and exit the Hummingbot interface. In case of errors, the command `exit -f` will force the application to close.

!!! tip
    You can also press the keyboard shortcut `CTRL + C` twice to exit.

## Updating Hummingbot

Once a month, we publish an official [release](/governance/releases) of Hummingbot and Hummingbot Gateway, marked by code release on Github and DockerHub and the publication of the [release notes](/release-notes).

Subscribe to the [Hummingbot Newletter](https://hummingbot.substack.com/) to get notified when a new release ships.

### Docker

Users of the Docker version of Hummingbot can update their instances to the latest image, which is updated with each release (e.g. `hummingbot/hummingbot:latest`).

See [Useful Docker Commands](/installation/docker/#useful-docker-commands) for how to manage your containers. For example, you can update the Compose project for the latest images:

```
docker compose up --force-recreate --build -d
```

### Source

For users who have installed from source, they can update their Hummingbot branches to `master` (with every release) or `development` branch (updated continually):

```
git checkout [branch]
git pull origin [branch]
```

## Keeping bots running in background

### Docker

Press keys <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> in sequence to detach from Docker, i.e., return to the command line. This exits out of Hummingbot without shutting down the container instance.

Use `docker attach [container_name]` to attach to an already-running bot in the background.

### Source

Use either `tmux` or `screen` to run multiple bots installed from source. Check out these external links how to use them.

- [Getting started with Tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/)
- [How to use Linux Screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/)

When using screen to run an instance in the background, run either of the following commands: `screen` or `screen -S $NAME`, where `$NAME` is what you wish to call this background instance. Use the latter to be more explicit if you want to run multiple bots.

Navigate to the folder where your separate Hummingbot is installed, then start the bot like normal.

```
conda activate hummingbot
bin/hummingbot.py
```

To exit the screen (detach), press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> in sequence.

To list all running instances, use `screen -ls`.

Log back into the screen by using either `screen` or `screen -r $NAME` to open a specific instance.
