## Revamped `hedge` Strategy

We awarded [HIP-19](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ip.eth/proposal/0xfd073ba4c7b4297ba202f59ece151f0f646cf11cd2b96946a7b5e89905490354) to community developer `leastchaos` who developed the [hedge](/strategies/hedge) strategy, so that he could revamped and improve it. The changes have now been released!

Here are the key changes:

- Cython ‚Üí Python: Simplified code for easier improvements in the future.
- One exchange ‚Üí Multiple Exchange: Allow hedging of multiple assets at multiple exchanges at the same time
- Hedge by amount ‚Üí Hedge by amount or value: Allow hedge based on the current asset value in quote asset.
- Remove restriction on spot/perp on both maker and taker: Able to select both spot and perpetual for both monitored market and hedge market
- Added fixed offset: Allow maintaining of a fixed net amount of asset amount/value.

## Improvements to AscendEx and Huobi connectors

The improvements below upgraded two of our certified exchanges to the latest CEX connector standard and should resolve issues that users have been encountering with them:

- [5891](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5891) Refactored the `Ascendex` spot connector to v2.1
- [5892](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5892) Refactored the `Huobi` spot connector to v2.1

## Gateway UX improvements

Installing Gateway from source should now be much easier, since we have modified the `generate_certs` command so that it automatically populates the correct path in Gateway's `ssl.yml` file. The [Gateway developer setup docs](/developers/gateway/setup/) now reflect this new, simpler workflow. In addition, we also added prompts to guide users in using Gateway commands intended for Docker and non-Docker use cases in this pull request.

- [5918](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5918) Added support for configurable cert paths for Gateway

We also changed the default `TokenList` settings for each Gateway DEX connector so that it uses a local file rather than a URL. See the new [Adding Tokens](/gateway/tokens) documentation page for more information.

- [5953](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5953) Changed the default tokenlists from URLs to files in gateway

## Changes to governance and maintenance process

In this [blog post](https://blog.hummingbot.org/changes-to-hummingbot-maintenance-and-governance-processes/), we described some big upcoming changes to our monthly process. Starting in January, we will use regular Snapshot polls to let HBOT holders decide how maintenance bandwidth should be allocated the various exchanges, strategies, and issues. In particular, exchanges and strategies will need to get a certain minimum number of HBOT votes to stay in the codebase.

This month, we started the process by removing exchanges from the codebase that don't seem to be operational anymore:

- [5943](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5943) Removed `Blocktane` and `CoinFlex` connector and other references from the codebase

We also started a [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/530578568154054663/1054516248014233610/1054851702865543218) that lets users nominate issues for the first Issues Poll later this month.
