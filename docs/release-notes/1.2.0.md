## Developer Updates

- Added formatting to the printout tables in the client CLI. Also allows the user to set the format in the config using `tables_format`
- Added creation timestamp to `in flight orders`
- Refactor `PaperTradeExchange` to use the `BudgetChecker` when simulating order fills
- Avellaneda - a multiplier to normalize the `risk factor` for all assets. The `risk_factor` now is a fraction / percentage / multiplier of the asset's volatility
- Pure market making - split and allow multiple order level spread
- Separate `order update` from `order fill` in `order tracker`
