## Directional Framework

This release adds the first components of the Directional Framework mentioned in our [2023 Technical Roadmap](https://blog.hummingbot.org/technical-roadmap-2023/):

> Execution bot: Bot that receives signals that based on local rules, create a new position and control three barriers: (1) stop loss, (2) take profit and (3) time limit. After execution, the bot can send trading status and history to other destinations.

[6026](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6026) added the `PositionExecutor` smart component. This component receives as input the strategy and the `PositionConfig`, which is a new data type that includes the information needed to start a directional position on a perpetuals exchange that utilizes the [triple barrier method](https://www.mlfinlab.com/en/latest/labeling/tb_meta_labeling.html) popularized in [Advances in Financial Machine Learning](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Advances+in+Financial+Machine+Learning-p-9781119482086) by Martin Prado.

For now, the component is controlled by the strategy by calling the method control position every tick, but is going to be improved by creating an async task that is going to execute this process until the executor is done.

Watch our monthly [developer call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X63rACPjtUE) for an explanation of the directional framework.

## Custom OHLCV Candles

Our 2023 technical roadmap post also mentioned a project to help users generate custom indicators using exchange data:

> Many of the traders and Hummingbot developers are interested in add indicators to their strategies.

> Currently, the only way to do this with Hummingbot right now is using trailing indicators (per-tick price data collected by the bot), but this solution is not suitable for candlestick indicators, since you have to get historical data to construct the OHLCs needed.

> That‚Äôs why one of the projects will be the OHLC Generator, that will allow users to initialize their strategies with multiple OHLCs (time or volume based). In addition, we plan to support third-party library like ta-lib so that users can compute and create various indicators.

[6046](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6046) added a candles data feed for [binance](/exchanges/binance) and [binance-perpetual](/exchanges/binance-perpetual). This "signal factory" component allows users to generate custom OHLCV candles using both historical and live Websocket data, allowing traders to use technical indicators to code directional strategies.

A base class is provided to add more candle providers and a `CandlesFactory` is also included to simplify the creation of the candles. We encourage community members to add data feeds for other exchanges.

## New Gateway Standalone Repo and Docs

Gateway is now a standalone repository: <https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway>. It has a similar license, folder structure, and contribution process to Hummingbot. In addition, the Gateway DockerHub is located at: <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hummingbot/gateway>.

In addition, we have significantly updated the Gateway installation process. Now, users can install Gateway from source or via Docker, similarly to Hummingbot. The newly updated [Gateway documentation](https://docs.hummingbot.org/gateway/) show you how to install and use Gateway with Hummingbot. 

In addition, the [`/deploy-examples`](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples) repo shows you how to set up Hummingbot and Gateway with Docker Compose.

- [6080](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6080) Removed Gateway from Hummingbot repo
- [6092](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6092) Removed the gateway `start`, `stop` and `create` commands since the new setup is different
- [6063](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6063) Simplified Gateway certs management

- [simple_directional_script_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/advanced_directional_strategy_example.py): Creates a simple directional strategy that uses RSI
- [advanced_directional_script_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/simple_directional_strategy_example.py): Creates an advanced directional strategy that uses both RSI and Bollinger Bands
- [microprice_calculator.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/microprice_calculator.py): Computes the [microprice](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2970694) price estimator using exchange data

See our [January developer call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X63rACPjtUE) for an explanation of the two directional scripts above, as well as [this video](https://youtu.be/S7eig5VXFpY?t=2439) from Sasha Stoikov in which he discusses the microprice indicator and runs Hummingbot.

## New CEX Connector: `btc-markets`

Per [PRP-6052](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0x3766f03b59e8484a80e0ba5a774aca43962a024ab46c9cc15b0a96656df1dc99), we are happy to welcome the `btc-markets` connector back to the Hummingbot codebase!
