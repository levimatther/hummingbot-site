All scripts examples can be found [here](/scripts/examples/).

## New Connector: Eve Exchange

Eve brings together all the necessary features for individuals & businesses to harness the power of crypto, in a single low-cost platform ‚Äî powered by EVE token.

## New Community Tool: Manage Bot Cycles

The purpose of this folder structure and scripts is to make it easier to manage multiple bots and launch them all at once on your computer or server.
