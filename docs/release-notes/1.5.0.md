## New Gateway DEX Connector: TraderJoe

[TraderJoe](https://traderjoexyz.com/) is an [AMM DEX](/gateway/exchanges) on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain that offers DeFi services, including swapping, staking and yield farming. The exchange has been growing rapidly, attracting over $4 billion in total value locked (TVL) since it was launched in June 2021. Trader Joe claims to take a community-first approach, and to prioritize innovation, speed and safety. It aims to provide a one-stop-shop DeFi experience and to integrate new products without compromising on security.

See the [`traderjoe`](/gateway/exchanges/traderjoe/) documentation for more information.

## New Gateway DEX Connector: Sushiswap

[SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) (SUSHI) is an [AMM DEX](/gateway/exchanges) built on the Ethereum network. Originally forked from Uniswap, SushiSwap leverages smart contracts in order to provide liquidity pools that allow users to directly trade crypto assets — with no intermediary. Users can also become liquidity pool providers, supplying an equal value pair of two cryptocurrencies in order to receive rewards whenever anyone utilizes that pool. It is a decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocol.

See the [`sushiswap`](/gateway/exchanges/sushiswap/) documentation for more information.

## New Fixed Grid Strategy

In this release, we are happy to introduce the `fixed_grid` strategy for Hummingbot,  the first community strategy created under the Developer Grant proposal [HGP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0xd0c5b54badfd631d7433da0f76795a9dc0d82fc66596d547cda2f3537f903e3f)

The `fixed_grid` strategy is similar to "Grid Trading Bot" strategies available on popular exchanges such as Binance and Kucoin, which are often the entry point of users to algorithmic trading in crypto. The strategy may provide a useful tool for market making in consolidating or range-bound markets, as well as for stablecoin pairs.

The main parameters needed to set up this strategy are `grid_price_ceiling`, `grid_price_floor`, `n_levels` (the number of grid levels).

See the `fixed_grid` documentation for more information.

## Removed Documentation for `celo-arb`, `uniswap-v3-lp`, and `balancer`

We have removed the documentation pages for the `celo-arb` amd `uniswap-v3-lp` strategies since they were designed to work with DEX connectors in Gateway-V1, an earlier, deprecated version of [Gateway](/gateway). For the same reason, we have removed the `balancer` connector page.

We plan to restore these pages if the community adds support for UbeSwap (Celo), Balancer, and Uniswap-V3, respectively, in future releases.
