# Release Notes - Version 1.16.0

*Released on May 29, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the May 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.16.0) today!

This release adds the first iteration of Hummingbot Dashboard, a powerful new way to visualize and analyze your strategies. It also greatly simplifies the Docker installation process, added market orders support to top exchange connectors, and introduces connectors to the Algorand blockchain, Phemex, and more!

!!! note "New trades DB columns"
    This release adds new columns to the trades database stored for each strategy/script to support the new Hummingbot Dashboard. As a result, we recommend that if you are updating from an older version of Hummingbot and want to run an strategy created using that older version, you should back up and delete the associated `.sqlite` file related to that strategy located in the `/data` folder. Failure to do so may result in errors upon re-starting the strategy.

## Hummingbot Dashboard

[![](/assets/img/dashboard.png)](/assets/img/dashboard.png)

Formerly called Streamlit-Apps, the new [Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard) lets you visualize and analyze a strategy, even as it's running in real-time. 

This is an experimental new module that we are still prototyping, and we welcome the community to test out and provide feedback. We plan to make significant improvements to this dashboard in the next few releases.


## Installation Improvements

We have streamlined the installation process so that there is a single `environment.yml` file in the `setup` folder. In addition, the Hummingbot Docker image can now be built using a simple command for multiple architectures, making it more accessible across a range of systems, including `x86` and `ARM` architectures.  These modifications are expected to enhance the overall user experience by simplifying the setup process and making Hummingbot more adaptable across a wide range of systems.

## Market Orders Support

Following our [Technical Roadmap](https://blog.hummingbot.org/technical-roadmap-2023/), we are expanding our connectors to support to include all order types offered by an exchange. In this release, we and community developers have added the integration of `market_order` and `limit_maker_order` types for the following exchanges:

* [Binance](/exchanges/binance)
* [Gate.io Perpetual](/exchanges/gate-io-perpetual)
* [dydx](/exchanges/dydx-perpetual)

## New Script Examples

This release added the following new [Script](/scripts) examples and improvements to existing ones:

- [1overN_portfolio](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/1overN_portfolio.py): This strategy aims to create a 1/N cryptocurrency portfolio, providing perfect diversification without parametrization and giving a reasonable baseline performance. **Thanks to Botcamp member Roland Kofler for this contribution! üôè**

- [spot_perp_arb](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/spot_perp_arb.py):  This script improves upon and addresses problems with the current [spot perp arbitrage](/strategies/spot-perpetual-arbitrage) strategy. It is designed to simultaneously initiate a long position in the spot market and a short position in the perpetual market when the opening signal is triggered. These positions are then closed upon receiving the closing signal. The profit is generated from the corrective motion between the spot price and the perpetual price. **Thanks to Botcamp member [riven314](https://github.com/riven314) for this contribution! üôè**

- [download_candles.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/download_candles.py): This script was improved by incorporating the capacity to download data across various intervals, thereby allowing simultaneous access to multiple timeframes. **Pull Request:** [#6289](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6289)

## New Chain/DEX Connectors: Algorand/Tinyman
