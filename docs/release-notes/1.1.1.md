# Release Notes - Version 1.1.1

This release is a hotfix to version [1.1.0](/release-notes/1.1.0).

Refactor of the logic that collects anonymous trade volume metrics and sends the information to Hummingbot Foundation. The previous logic that associated metrics collection to processing the logs has been removed. 
The new logic associates the trades volume metrics collection directly to the connectors, and uses the events to gather trades (or order fills). More information about the hotfix here [#5173](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5173).
