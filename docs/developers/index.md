This section is for developers looking to contribute to Hummingbot or extend its capabilities:

* [Debug console](/developers/debug): Inspect and modify Hummingbot's state at runtime
* [Building CEX Connectors](/developers/connectors): Build centralized exchange (CEX) connectors
* [Building DEX Connectors](/gateway/adding-dex-connectors): Build decentralized exchange (DEX) connectors
* [Building Strategies](/developers/strategies): Create and customize your own Hummingbot strategies
* [Adding Commands](/developers/commands): Create your own Hummingbot commands

!!! tip "Try Scripts instead of Strategies"
    Check out [Scripts](/scripts) as a lighter alternative to building strategies. Scripts are single Python files that give you the same power of Strategies with easier access for developers.
