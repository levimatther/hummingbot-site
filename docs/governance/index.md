The purpose of the Hummingbot Foundation is to empower the HBOT token holders to govern many aspects of Hummingbot, such as:

* Approving pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Proposing improvements and architectural changes to the Hummingbot codebase
* Modifying parameters of the HBOT governance system
* Electing the foundation's Board of Directors
* Allocating grants and other expenditures of the community treasury

## Key Artifacts

Hummingbot Foundation maintains the resources below to make the governance process transparent to the community:

* [HBOT Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1UNAumPMnXfsghAAXrfKkPGRH9QlC8k7Cu1FGQVL1t0M/edit?usp=sharing): A public Google Sheet maintained by the Foundation, this shows you the real-time HBOT circulating supply, approved proposals, active bounties, and HBOT distributions.

* [Foundation Calendar](https://hummingbot-foundation.notion.site/5c767683f80b45c4934aa8cf755a2ff5?v=4dd057ac162f49c9813e11cec0688204): Upcoming release dates, monthly polls, community calls, and other events.

* [Bounties Board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/7/views/1): A public Github board for bug fixes and proposed enhancements with development bounties attached to them.

* [Pull Request Status](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/1): A public Github board for active pull requests that are being voted on, reviewed, and merged.

## Getting Started

* [Bounties](/bounties): Earn bounties for making improvements to the Hummingbot codebase and creating content. Check out the guides for [Contributors](/bounties/contributors) and [Sponsors](/bounties/sponsors).

* [Polls](polls.md): Vote in monthly polls that determine which exchanges, strategies, and issues receive bounties and other improvements.

* [Proposals](proposals.md): Create and vote on proposals to steer the evolution of Hummingbot.

## Platforms

We use a number of platforms that enable community engagement in different ways. Below, we offer guidance to help the community decide how to participate in governance.

### Discord

The **Governance** category in our [Discord](http://discord.gg/hummingbot) has various channels that users can use to discuss proposals and polls, as well as general discussions.

### Snapshot

All **proposal voting** occur on the offical Hummingbot [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth), which features an off-chain, gas-less voting system that allows you to vote by signing messages using your HBOT token balance as of a certain block.

Each proposal type has its Snapshot sub-space:

* Pull Request Proposals (PRP): <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-prp.eth>
* Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIP): <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ip.eth>
* Hummingbot Governance Proposals (HGP): <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth>

## More Information

* [Releases](releases.md): Process of reviewing and merging pull requests into official monthly releases
* [Epochs](epochs.md): Quarterly periods with fixed exchange and strategy tiers that are defined via polls
* [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md): Originally published in December 2021, this document that explains the Foundation's goals and how its governance system works
