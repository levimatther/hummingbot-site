A Strategy is a template for an algorithmic trading strategy that users can configure, extend, and run. The trading strategy itself is a continual process that monitors trading pairs on one or more exchanges in order to make trading decisions.

Strategies separate **trading logic**, open source code that defines how the strategy behaves, versus **parameters**, user-defined variables like spread and order amount that control how the strategy is deployed against live market conditions. Strategy parameters are stored in a local **config file** that is not exposed externally.

Strategies utilize the standardized trading interfaces exposed by exchange and protocol connectors, enabling developers to write code that can be used across many exchanges. Each Hummingbot strategy is a sub-folder in the [`/hummingbot/strategy`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy) folder.

## Strategy Tiers

Quarterly [Polls](/governance/polls) allow the Hummingbot community to vote using HBOT tokens to decide which strategies in the codebase should be core strategies maintained by the Foundation:

### Core

Core strategies are maintained and continually improved by Hummingbot Foundation. Foundation staff focuses on testing these strategies and rewards users who answer questions related to these strategies on Discord.

## Strategy Maintenance

Strategies may have a maintainer who is responsible for ongoing maintenance: fixing bugs, addressing user issues, and keeping up with Hummingbot codebase updates. Specifically, maintainer responsibilities include:

* Addressing user Github issues and pull requests related to the strategy
* Keeping the strategy updated for changes to the connector changes for each exchange type supported by the strategy
* Keeping the strategy's documentation page updated

## Contributing Strategies

We encourage users to create and extend Strategy templates for their own purposes, and if they so desire, share them with the community.

Developers may submit strategies for review. Please note the [Contribution Guidelines](/developers/contributions/). For developers interested to create or customize their own strategies, please see [Strategies](/developers/strategies) in the Developers section.
